What is the difference between declaration, definition and initialization?

What is Declaration? 
This is when a variable is registered using a given name within the corresponding scope, (e.g. inside a function).
 declaration types include let, const and var

For example; (let)

var name = "Tiffany";
if(name === "Tiffany"){
  let hello = "Hello Tiffany";
} else {
  let hello = "Hi";
}
console.log(hello);


For example: (var)
function sayHello(){
  var hello = "Hello World";
  return hello;
}
console.log(hello);


For example: (const)

const x = "Hello World";


What is Initialization?
When you declare a variable it is automatically initialized, which means memory is allocated for the variable by the JavaScript engine.

For example:
var foo; {Good Morning World}

What is Definition?
This states that a variable is declared and memory is allocated to the variable. It is also used to define a previously declared name.

For example:
var foo; { }     

it may be empty but var foo has been given a value/memory and is thus defined.
